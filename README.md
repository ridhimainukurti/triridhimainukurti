## Test Prep Plans 
**Goal: 5 on AP Exam**
Complete each of the challenges that are presented within each of the tech talks. Also in my spare time look over the collegeboard videos and review any units that I feel that I need to improve on. Then look over previous college board FRQ's and try to complete one to the best of my capability each weekend in order to become more comfortable with solving the free response questions in a limited amount of time (be sure to time myself). Also get a AP Computer Science A prep book and work on the questions given there in order to improve for the multiple choice questions

### Challenge 1 ~ Sorts 

Big O complexity with sorts gives to the notation to measure the upper bound performance of each of the algorithms.
merge sort: (n log(n))
bubble sort: (n) 
insertion sort: (n) 
selection sort: (n^2) 

In order to demonstrate the ability to be able to execute multiple sorts we tried executing it so that it portrayed the concept well. Another thing we focused on was the different sorts which were the bubble sort, insertion sort and selection sort. 

With the bubble sort I focused on demonstrating how it moves onto the next item or element within the arraylist by traversing through the array and holding a tempm variable that would be used in order to move to the next element. 

```java
public void sort() {
    int n = undone.length;
    // iterate through each possible pair in the list
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n - 1 - i; j++) {
        compare++;
        // if the value with larger index is smaller in value, then swap the two values
        if (undone[j] > undone[j+1]) {
          sort++;
          int temp = undone[j];
          undone[j] = undone[j+1];
          undone[j+1] = temp;
        }
      }
    }
  }
```
Also I focused on the insertion sort where it look for the place to which the item or object should move towards and goes through a for loop process that also traverses through the array. It looks for the position to which it can be inserted and takes the element and moves it to the new locationn to where it needs to be inserted. 

```java
public void sort() {
    int n = undone.length;
    // iterate through each element of the array as the starting comparison
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      int value = undone[i];
      int j = i - 1;

      // if the current element is smaller than value before it, continue to look back until it is no longer smaller and insert the element there
      //Sort all of the other elements up a position to make space.
      while (j >= 0 && undone[j] > value) {
        compare++;
        sort++;
        undone[j+1] = undone[j];
        j--;
      }
      undone[j+1] = value;
      compare++;
    }
  }
```

The last sort that I analyzed at was the fact that there was a selection sort which chooses the location to which the sort can be used for and then proceeds to insert that cetain element within that locaio in order to move to the next part which is then done by th for loop that again travereses through the array in order to get the element or object to that specific location. 

```java 
public void sort() {
    int n = undone.length;
    // iterate through each element of list as starting index
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
      int min = i;
      // within this sublist that has starting index of i, find the minimum value
      for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
        compare++;
        if (undone[j] < undone[min]) {
          min = j;
        }
      }
      // sort minimum value to the start of the list.
      int temp = undone[min];
      undone[min] = undone[i];
      undone[i] = temp;
      sort++;
    }
  }
```



### Challenge 1 ~ Calculator 

In order to pop the tokens from the tokenized list and calculate them I had to use the reverse polish notation and calculate the results. First I had to tokenize all the elemnts within the math expression.

```java
private void termTokenizer() {
        // contains final list of tokens
        this.tokens = new ArrayList<>();

        int start = 0;  // term split starting index
        StringBuilder multiCharTerm = new StringBuilder();    // term holder
        for (int i = 0; i < this.expression.length(); i++) {
            Character c = this.expression.charAt(i);
            if ( isOperator(c.toString() ) || isSeperator(c.toString())  ) {
                // 1st check for working term and add if it exists
                if (multiCharTerm.length() > 0) {
                    tokens.add(this.expression.substring(start, i));
                }
                // Add operator or parenthesis term to list
                if (c != ' ') {
                    tokens.add(c.toString());
                }
                // Get ready for next term
                start = i + 1;
                multiCharTerm = new StringBuilder();
            } else {
                // multi character terms: numbers, functions, perhaps non-supported elements
                // Add next character to working term
                multiCharTerm.append(c);
            }

        }
        // Add last term
        if (multiCharTerm.length() > 0) {
            tokens.add(this.expression.substring(start));
        }
    }
```

Then I had to conver them to polish notation. Once that was completed the reverse polish notation had to be calculated and in order for the calculator to understand the PEMDAS process I had to feed through multiple if statements in order to tell the calculator that once this operator was in place it needed to take the first two tokens and perform this action. 

```java
public void reversePolishNotationToResult() {
    //need a new stack to pop seperate the numbers and operators
    Stack calculate = new Stack();

    //need to go through each of the tokens in the reverse polish notation 
    for (String tokens : reverse_polish) {
      if (!isOperator(tokens)) {
        //trying to push the number to the stack using the methods of the Operators 
        Double num = Double.parseDouble(tokens);
        calculate.push(num);
      }

      else {
        // tryig to pop of the first two entries as done in the example during the tech talk 
        Double temporary1 = (Double)calculate.pop();
        Double temporary2 = (Double)calculate.pop();
        Double ans = 0.0;

        if (tokens.equals("^")) {
          ans = Math.pow(temporary2, temporary1);
        }
        
        if (tokens.equals("*")) {
          ans = temporary1 * temporary2;
        }
        
        if (tokens.equals("/")) {
          ans = temporary2 / temporary1; 
        }

        if (tokens.equals("%")) {
          ans = temporary2 % temporary1;
        }
        
        if (tokens.equals("+")) {
          ans = temporary2 + temporary1;
        }
        
        if (tokens.equals("-")) {
          ans = temporary2 - temporary1;
        }

        calculate.push(ans);
      }
    }

    result = (Double)calculate.pop();
    
  }
```

Then I had just used to the toString method to print out the results and make sure that everything was properly calculting the math expressions and printing out the correct result 

```java
ublic String toString() {
    return ("Original expression: " + this.expression + "\n" +
            "Tokenized expression: " + this.tokens.toString() + "\n" +
            "Reverse Polish Notation: " +this.reverse_polish.toString() + "\n" +
            "Final result: " + String.format("%.2f", this.result));
  }
```

Another one is the merge sorts where it has multiple sorts that are combined together as one and then executed in one shot which is done through a for loop traversing the array and printing out the merge sort. 

```java
public void sort(int[] a, int n) {
    if (n < 2) {
      return;
    }
    
    int mid = n / 2;
    int[] l = new int[mid];
    int[] r = new int[n - mid];

    for (int i = 0; i < mid; i++ ) {
      l[i] = a[i];
    }
    for (int j = mid; j < n; j++ ) {
      r[j - mid] = a[j];
    }

    sort(l, mid);
    sort(r, n - mid);

    mergeS(a, l, r, mid, n - mid);
    
  }
```

### Challenge 1 ~ Queue

Add elements into the queue and depending on the method written which in this case was our add and delete method, we can delete from the head of the connection or from the tail of the connection. 
```
public void add(T data) {
        // add new object to end of Queue
        LinkedList<T> tail = new LinkedList<>(data, null);

        if (head == null)  // initial condition
            this.head = this.tail = tail;
        else {  // nodes in queue
            this.tail.setNextNode(tail); // current tail points to new tail
            this.tail = tail;  // update tail
        }
    }
```
This is the deleting method below through which we are deleting from the tail of the connection and then assigning to the next head so that it keeps going. The iterator within the code will act as a for each and iterate through all of the elements. 
```

  // to delete the elements within the queue
    public void delete() {
      // looks at the current head and moves to the next link or head within the list
      this.head = head.getNext();
      // then sets the previous node or head as the tail while the one in front of it is the tail
      this.head.setPrevNode(tail);
    }
```

### Challenge 2 ~ Stacks 

Stacks is another data collection where the concept is to add certain elements within the stack and the first element added in is the last one out. Think of it as when you put the plates from the dishwasher into the cupboard. The last plate you add in is the first one to come out and use. Here below is the methods and classes written in order to build a stack in java. The below code will show the tester and what is actually running within replit. 

```
class StackTester {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {

        Object[] queuestart = new Integer[] { 1, 2, 3};
        Object[] stackfinal = new Integer[] {};
        QueueManager startq = new QueueManager("Integers", queuestart);

        
        Stack finals = new Stack();
        for (int i = 0; i < queuestart.length; i++) {
            finals.push(queuestart[i]);
        }
        System.out.println("\nQueue to Stack:");
        for (int i = 0; i < queuestart.length; i++) {
            System.out.print(finals.pop() + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();

    }
}
```

### Challenge 3 ~ Merge Queue

This is where there are the blending of two queues together into one. Below is the method witten to achieve that merge. 

```
public Queue<T> merged() {
    QueueIterator<T> firstQueue = new QueueIterator<T>(queue1);
    QueueIterator<T> secQueue = new QueueIterator<T>(queue2);
    Queue<T> mergedQueues = new Queue<T>();

    while (firstQueue.hasNext() && secQueue.hasNext()) {
      T first = firstQueue.next();
      T sec = secQueue.next();

      if ((int)first <= (int)sec) {
        mergedQueues.add(first);
      }
      else {
        mergedQueues.add(sec);
      }
    }

    return mergedQueues;
    
  }
```
This was done by adding both the first and second queues accordingly according the number and order of the elements within both of the queues. So therefore it combined the queues into numerical order. 

### Challenge 4 ~ LinkedLists 

This is where the elements are entered according to a certain collection where they are identified as the beginning and the end and therefore each of the elements are connected through a connection. Therefore within the LinkedList there is a head and a tail within the collection. 

```
public LinkedList(T data, LinkedList<T> node) {
    this.setData(data);
    this.setPrevNode(node);
    this.setNextNode(null);
  }

    /**
     *  Clone an object,
     *
     * @param  node  object to clone
     */
  public LinkedList(LinkedList<T> node) {
    this.setData(node.data);
    this.setPrevNode(node.prevNode);
    this.setNextNode(node.nextNode);
  }
```

### Challenge 1 ~ Menu

The data collection that is needed in order to create a dynamic menu is a hash map which is what I created below. 
```
//need to create the hashmap
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //created the HashMap object called Menu
        Map<Integer, Menu> menu = new HashMap<>();
        //in order to add key,value pairs into the HashMap need to have the put() method
        //add the java files that I want to run on menu
        menu.put(1, new Menu("ChallengeFRQ2", (IntByReference.main(null))));
        menu.put(2, new Menu("ChallengeFRQ3", (Matrix.main(null))));

        //once entered within the Menu we need to print the Menu out using a for loop
        //going through each of the HashMap's elements and traversing through them
        for (Map.Entry mapelement : menu.entrySet()) {
            //getting the key for each element within the HashMap
            int key = (int)mapelement.getKey;

            //now going to print the keys and values for each element within the HashMap
            System.out.println(key + "=" + mapelement.getValue()getBanner());
            
```

### Challenge 2 ~ IntByReference

I created the constructor that was needed which was the IntByReference
```
// Hack: create IntByReference, swapToLowHighOrder and toString methods

    //created the IntByReference constructor and intialized the private instance variable value
    public IntByReference(Integer value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
```

Then created the swapping method so that the numbers were sorted from least to greatest 
```
//swapping the numbers so it goes from least the greatest
    public void swapToLowHighOrder(IntByReference i) {
        //when the first value passed is greater than the second value passed then the swapping begins
        if (this.value > i.value) {
            //creates a variable placeholder to actually switch the value from one spot to the other
            int placeholder = this.value;
            this.value = i.value;
            placeholder = i.value;

        }
    }
```

Finally created the toString Method that printed the information out in a formatted way. 
```
//formatting the output into a particular way
    public String toString() {
        //String.format is a method that allows the output to be printed in a certain way according to the % characters
        //%d in reference to Decimal Integers
        return (String.format("%d", this.value));
    }
```

### Challenge 3 ~ Matrix

Created the toString method that had contained the nested for each loops that traversed through the rows and columns of the matrix. 
```
//creation of toString method
    public String toString() {

        //creation of the nested for loops (iterates through each row and column)
        //String builder creates a modifiable succession of characters
        StringBuilder finalresult = new StringBuilder();
        //for each loop that traverses through each row within the maxtrix
        for (int[] row : matrix) {
            //for each loop that traverses through each column within a row
            for (int cell : row ){
                //goes through each cell and prints out the hexadecimal for each cell
                finalresult.append((cell == -1) ? " " : String.format("%x",cell)).append(" "));
            }

            //create a new line to follow sample code's format
            finalresult.append("\n");
        }
        //returns that finalresult character sequence to the toString (connects all the strings together into one)
        return finalresult.toString();
    }
```

Then created the method that flipped the matrix using nested for loops (almost very similar to the code above). 
```
public String flip() {

        //creation of the nested for loops (iterates through each row and column)
        //String builder creates a modifiable succession of characters
        StringBuilder finalresult = new StringBuilder();
        //need to begin at the end of the row so use a for loop to move towards the end of the row and then to the beginning
        for (int i = matrix.length; 0 < i; i--) {
            //need to grow through each column for each row within the matrix
            for (int j = matrix[i - 1].length; 0 < j; j--) {
                //goes through each cell and prints out the value within it
                finalresult.append((matrix[i-1][j-1] == -1) ? " " : String.format("%x",matrix[i-1][j-1])).append(" "));
            }

            //create a new line to follow sample code's format
            finalresult.append("\n");
        }
        //returns that finalresult character sequence to the toString (connects all the strings together into one)
        return finalresult.toString();
    }
```
