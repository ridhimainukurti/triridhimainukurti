## Test Prep Plans 
**Goal: 5 on AP Exam**
Complete each of the challenges that are presented within each of the tech talks. Also in my spare time look over the collegeboard videos and review any units that I feel that I need to improve on. Then look over previous college board FRQ's and try to complete one to the best of my capability each weekend in order to become more comfortable with solving the free response questions in a limited amount of time (be sure to time myself). Also get a AP Computer Science A prep book and work on the questions given there in order to improve for the multiple choice questions
